## üîç Insights Summary
To drive business decisions, we focused on the Sales performance as a KPI

**1. Total Sales Performance**
- GameZone generated over $6,095,289.00 in total sales Over 3 Years.

**2. Yearly Sales Trends**
- Out of a total of $6 million in sales, the year 2020 contributed the highest amount with $4 million, followed by 2019 with $1.5 million. Sales in 2021 were significantly lower at only $500K, as the data covers just the first two months of the year.
- 
**3. Top Selling Products (By Sales)**
- The top three products 27in 4K Gaming Monitor, Nintendo Switch, and Sony PlayStation 5 Bundle, together contributed more than 80% of total sales, with individual sales of $1.95M, $1.64M, and $1.57M, respectively.
- On the other end, the lowest-performing product was the Razer Pro Gaming Headset, with only $879 in total sales. This may indicate missing or incomplete data, and it's recommended to verify this with the product team.
- 
**4. Marketing Channel Performance**
- GameZone utilizes five primary marketing channels to drive product sales: Direct, Email, Affiliate, Social Media, and Unknown sources.
- The Direct channel dominates, contributing over $5.16 million, which is 84.71% of the total sales.
Email marketing follows with $604K (9.92%), showing strong performance as a secondary channel.
Affiliate programs generated $220K (3.61%), while Social Media campaigns brought in $68K (1.13%).
Lastly, sales from Unknown sources accounted for only $38K (0.62%), which may require further tracking improvements.
- These insights suggest that while Direct and Email remain the strongest sales drivers, there may be opportunities to scale up Affiliate and Social Media channels to diversify performance.

**5. Sales Trend by Month (Yearly Aggregation)**
- An analysis of monthly sales across the dataset (2019‚Äì2021) reveals clear seasonal and campaign-related trends, with 2020 standing out as the strongest performing year overall.
- December 2020 was the peak sales month, generating $546,143, likely driven by year end promotions and holiday season demand.
- The top 10 months by sales volume were almost entirely from 2020, confirming its position as the company's most profitable year.
